## Car_Price_detection
Predicts the price of car using it's spec.


The speci-->feid variables are as follows:
--> fueltype	<br>
--> aspiration	<br>
--> doornumber<br>
-->	carbody<br>
-->	drivewheel<br>
-->	enginelocation<br>
-->	wheelbase<br>
-->	carlength<br>
-->	carwidth<br>
-->	carheight<br>
-->	curbweight<br>
-->	enginetype<br>
-->	cylindernumber<br>
-->	enginesize<br>
-->	fuelsystem<br>
-->	boreratio<br>
-->	stroke<br>
-->	compressionratio<br>
-->	horsepower<br>
-->	peakrpm<br>
-->	citympg<br>
-->	highwaympg<br>


##Concept

From the above tags....The useful variables were chosen.<br>
The car price was predicted with various models and their accuracies were compared.<br>
